Exercise (Mohamed): Using upper Standard Function
Develop a standalone Spark SQL application (using IntelliJ IDEA) that converts one or more string columns to upper case.

The standalone application should take at least two input parameters:

The path of a CSV data set to load
One or more column names
The output dataset should extend the current columns with new ones with their names including the “source”, e.g. if city column were used, the output could be upper_city.

Extra: Make sure the conversion happens on string columns only
